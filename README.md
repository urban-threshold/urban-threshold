# Urban Threshold - Terragazer

![img](TerraGazer.jpg)

Tourism in Australia accounts for over $35b of GDP in FY22, with youth tourism making up a significant portion of that figure (according to Tourism Australia). Youth tourism is also very important for the transfer of culture between generations, something that cannot be measured by numbers. We aim to increase the availability of youth tourism through our app Terragazer.

## Why is our app different? 

**Gamification:** The app uses the principle of gamification to engage modern youth. Users post short videos of tourist attractions and others try to guess their location. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guesses. 

**Point Redemption System:** Points earned in the app can be redeemed at local tourist attractions, such as restaurants, rides, and tours. This creates a micro-economy powered by tourism within the area and has the potential to replace traditional travel vouchers with a digital alternative.

**Travel Planning:** The app integrates travel planning features powered by machine learning, making it easier for users to book short holidays. The tool integrates with common travel agent tools, allowing the booking process to be fully automated. 

**Trip Summaries:** The app can summarize trips into short videos that incorporate key moments and challenges posted by the user while on the trip. These videos can be shared on the platform to gain additional points and promote tourist attractions even after the user has left the area.

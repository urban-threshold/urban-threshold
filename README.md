**Gamification:** The app uses the principle of gamification to engage modern youth. Users post short videos of tourist attractions and others try to guess their location. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guesses. 
**Point Redemption System: **Points earned in the app can be redeemed at local tourist attractions, such as restaurants, rides, and tours. This creates a micro-economy powered by tourism within the area and has the potential to replace traditional travel vouchers with a digital alternative. 
**Travel Planning:** The app integrates travel planning features powered by machine learning, making it easier for users to book short holidays. The tool integrates with common travel agent tools, allowing the booking process to be fully automated. 
**Trip Summaries:** The app can summarize trips into short videos that incorporate key moments and challenges posted by the user while on the trip. These videos can be shared on the platform to gain additional points and promote tourist attractions even after the user has left the area.
